FortiAnalyzer CSV Data Explorer


#Introducing FortiAnalyzer CSV Data Explorer (FACSVDE)

#Are you tired of manually sifting through massive amounts of log data from your FortiAnalyzer? Do you 
#wish you had an easier way to analyze and visualize and export small specific subsets of the large datasets, so you can quickly identify trends, 
#patterns, and potential security threats?

#Look no further! This tool is designed specifically for reading and analyzing FortiAnalyzer 
#exported data - perfect for managing and monitoring your network's activity over a specific period of 
#time. Whether it's a week's worth of data or a month's worth, our app makes it easy to navigate and 
#extract insights from large datasets.  Fortianalyzer exports top out at 5 million rows.  

#Key Features:
#Read and analize large exported logs from fortianalizer, and select open large file and let it do the heavy lifting.
#Preview - 10 rows of selected filtered data prior to exporting.
#Click load file again, without having to wait for the data to change category or user info!
#Find what the users have been up to by user name.
#Searching by category displays in the console a list of all unquie categories found.
